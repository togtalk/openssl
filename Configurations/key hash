yes please help me.
Android apps must be digitally signed with a release key before you can upload them to the store. To generate a hash of your release key, run the following command on Mac or Windows substituting your release key alias and the path to your keystore:

keytool -exportcert -alias YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS -keystore YOUR_RELEASE_KEY_PATH | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64

This will generate a 28-character string that you should copy and paste into the field below. Also, see the Android documentation for signing your apps.
